abstract: The apparatus of non-abelian Hodge theory can be made very exlicit in
  the abelian case (i.e. for the group $\\mathrm{GL}_1$). This was carefully
  made in [[1]](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2400111). It is
  instructive to put the stress on the non complex nature of the map from the
  Dolbeault model to the Betti one, and the highly transcendental nature of the
  holomorphic map form de Rham to Betti, given by integrating differential
  equations. One can emphasize differences between the three models, e.g. the de
  Rham model is Stein but has no regular functions, whereas the Betti model is
  affine. If time allows some discussion of the results in
  [[2]](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1046569) would be
  interesting.
